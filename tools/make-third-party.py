"""Build THIRD-PARTY.json, the notice finstats ships for the code it is built on.

Input:  `cargo metadata` for the dependency graph, and the crate sources cargo has already
        unpacked (~/.cargo/registry/src/...), where every crate keeps its own LICENSE files.
Output: one entry per crate — name, version, SPDX expression, repository — and the licence
        texts themselves, deduplicated: hundreds of crates ship the same MIT wording, so the
        texts are listed once each and every crate points at the ones it carries.

    cargo fetch && python3 tools/make-third-party.py

Re-run it whenever a dependency is added, removed or bumped: `cargo test` fails while the file
does not cover every package in Cargo.lock. The bundled fonts and the map are not crates and
are not in here; `src/licenses.rs` adds those from the licence files next to them.
