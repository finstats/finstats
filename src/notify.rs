//! What finstats has to say, and where it says it.
//!
//! Everything finstats works out is otherwise only visible on a page somebody has to remember to open.
//! This is the one way out: an *event* is raised where the thing is noticed, and every *destination*
//! that asked for that kind of event is sent a message about it.
//!
//! This is also the first thing finstats ever sends anywhere, so the rules are narrow and every one of
//! them is a test rather than a habit:
//!
//! - **Nothing leaves unless it was asked for.** A destination is a row somebody entered, with the kinds
//!   of event it wants ticked. No destination, no request; an unticked kind, no request.
//! - **Addresses and places stay behind a switch.** An event carries two bags: `data`, which any
//!   destination may be told, and `private` — IP addresses, coordinates — which is only rendered for a
//!   destination whose owner switched "include addresses" on. `message()` is the only thing that can
//!   reach either, so the rule holds by construction.
//! - **An event is written once.** `raise` is `INSERT OR IGNORE` on `dedupe`, exactly like
//!   `security_alerts`, so deriving the same thing twice sends nothing twice. Delivery is a separate row
//!   per destination with its own attempts and clock: a webhook that is down delays nothing else.
//! - **Nothing old is ever sent.** Something found more than `HISTORIC_S` after it happened is recorded
//!   and marked `historic`, and a destination never hears about anything that happened before it existed.
//!   Between them, adding a destination cannot flood it with a year of history.
//! - **A personal destination carries exactly what its owner can see in the app** (`Need`, checked against
//!   the same `Perms` every page is checked against), and may only point at a public host: it is somebody
//!   else's address that finstats would be making requests to.
