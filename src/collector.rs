//! Watches what is playing on Jellyfin and turns it into playback rows.
//!
//! A play is written the moment it is first seen (`active = 1`) and refreshed while it
//! runs, so a crash or restart loses at most a few seconds. Time is only counted while
//! the player is not paused, which makes `duration_s` "time actually watched".
//!
//! Two transports, one producer, each doing the half it is good at. The session list arrives either
//! by asking (`GET /Sessions`, on a timer) or by being told (`socket.rs`, pushed); `tick()` cannot
//! tell the difference and does not care — it is handed a list and works out what changed.
//!
//! **Nothing playing: listen.** An idle server has nothing to report, and asking it every few seconds
//! to be told so was almost all the traffic finstats ever caused. Not one request goes out.
//! **Something playing: ask,** at `active_interval_s`, until the last play ends. A pause, a seek or a
//! track change is only as sharp as the gap between two sightings, and how often a server pushes is
//! its business, not ours; asking is also what ends a play whose client vanished without saying so,
//! since the push carries no `ActiveWithinSeconds`. Reads are compressed, so the busy half is cheap.
//!
//! The moment the socket stops carrying, polling resumes on the very next pass — never a gap, because
//! a play that is never seen is lost for good.
