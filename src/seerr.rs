//! Seerr (the merged Overseerr / Jellyseerr): who asked for what, and how it is going.
//!
//! Field names and numbers are Seerr's own (`server/entity/*.ts`; its API description leaves several out).
//! A request carries ids and no title: the title comes from the library when the thing is there, from
//! Sonarr or Radarr when they have it, and only then from Seerr's `/movie/{id}` or `/tv/{id}`, once.
//!
//! **Reading.** A pass begins by asking for a single row, newest-modified first: if that one `updatedAt` is no
//! newer than the cursor, nothing has been created or changed and the pass is over: about a kilobyte, rather
//! than the page of fifty a listing costs. When something has changed, the listing is read newest-modified first
//! and stops a little past the newest change already known (`OVERLAP_S`, measured on Seerr's clock, so ours does
//! not matter). That alone would miss a request whose *media* became available, because that does not always touch
//! the request. So every request FinStats believes to be open is looked at again (the ones a fresh
//! "pending/processing" listing returns anyway, the rest one by one), but only while something *is* open, and at
//! most every `OPEN_EVERY_S`: a title that has arrived is news within the quarter hour, not within the minute.
//! Once a day everything is listed, and only if that listing was complete does a request that is no longer there
//! get its `removed_at`.
//!
//! **Who.** A Seerr user is the Jellyfin user whose id Seerr reports (`jellyfinUserId`), failing that the one
//! with that Jellyfin user name. Never the display name or e-mail: those are typed by the person, and a
//! name of one's own choosing must not put requests on somebody else's page.
