//! The four ways a message leaves finstats, and nothing else about notifications.
//!
//! A plain **webhook** (JSON, the shape documented in `docs/api.md`), **Discord** (an embed),
//! **ntfy** and **Gotify**. Two rules hold for all of them:
//!
//! - **The address is a secret.** A Discord webhook URL *is* its credential, and an ntfy topic is
//!   whoever knows it, so a URL is never logged, never put in an error and never sent to a browser.
//!   Errors say a status and a kind of failure, the way `services.rs` does, and nothing the other side
//!   returned.
//! - **No redirect is followed.** These requests carry tokens in headers and in the URL itself;
//!   `services::Http` already refuses redirects, so it is the client used here too.
//!
//! Both ntfy and Gotify are published to in their JSON form rather than through headers, because a title
//! is a film title: "Amélie" in an HTTP header is not something to find out about in the field.
