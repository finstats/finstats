//! Jellyfin's own background jobs: what they are, in plain words, and how far along they are.
//!
//! Jellyfin lists its scheduled tasks under names like "Detect and Analyze Media Segments", which says
//! what the code is called rather than what it is doing to your server. `explain` answers the question
//! the name does not: what it goes through, why you would want it, and whether it is one of the heavy
//! ones. Unknown tasks (a plugin's own) fall back to Jellyfin's description, and say where they came from.
//!
//! **A run is timed by watching it, because Jellyfin does not say when it started.** A task carries a
//! percentage and nothing else — no start time for the run in progress — so `Watch` remembers the
//! percentages this finstats has seen and `eta_s` works the rest out from the rate they moved at. When
//! nothing has been seen to move there is no number, and the page says so rather than guessing.
//!
//! **The watching does not wait for somebody to look.** `observe` feeds the same `Watch` from task lists
//! finstats has already read for other reasons — the scan check every 5 minutes, the server details every
//! 15 — so a run that has been going for an hour is an estimate the moment the page opens, instead of an
//! ellipsis until it has been watched. Those reads happen either way; this only stops throwing the
//! percentages in them away.
//!
//! **Nothing is asked for unless somebody is looking.** The list is read from Jellyfin *for this endpoint*
//! at most every `MIN_GAP_S`, only when it is called, and finstats never starts, stops or changes a task
//! there: it is the same read-only relationship as everywhere else.
