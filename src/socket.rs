//! Jellyfin's `/socket`: the sessions the collector used to ask for, pushed as they change.
//!
//! This is a *transport*, not a second producer. What arrives here is the very list `GET /Sessions`
//! answers; it is handed to `collector::tick()` untouched, so one piece of code still writes every
//! play. Three things make a socket different from a poll, and each has an answer here:
//!
//!   * **Casing.** Every HTTP read asks for `profile="PascalCase"` (see `jellyfin.rs`), and a
//!     WebSocket handshake cannot: it is one GET whose `Accept` the server ignores. A server that
//!     answers camelCase would make `record_from_session` return `None` for every session: no plays
//!     at all, silently. So keys are put back into PascalCase here, and the first snapshot is held
//!     against one real `/Sessions` read before a single row is written from it.
//!   * **No `ActiveWithinSeconds`.** The push is the server's whole session list, so a client that
//!     vanished without saying stop lingers with something "playing". Nothing that is playing is ever
//!     judged by the push alone: the collector asks for the list itself for as long as anything is,
//!     and that is what ends such a play.
//!   * **Silence.** A socket can stop delivering without closing, which a poll cannot, but silence is
//!     also the *normal* state here: Jellyfin pushes a session list when something changes and sends
//!     nothing at all while nobody is watching, for hours. So what is watched is the server answering,
//!     not sessions arriving: FinStats sends `KeepAlive` and Jellyfin answers, and nothing heard for
//!     `LOST_AFTER` is death. Judging a quiet socket by its sessions is what made 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 drop
//!     the connection every fifteen seconds on an idle server and never stop polling.
//!
//! A play that is never seen cannot be reconstructed, so every doubt here resolves towards polling.
